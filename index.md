# A little bit about me

<img src=Images/IMG_9715.jpg width="225" height="250" />

Hello! My name is Paul Peng. I'm a 4th year at UCSD studying biochemistry and mathematics-computer science. I have experience with the major programming languages (python, java, C and C++) and am familiar with markdown. 

Not sure what people want to see for the code section, but here's a python method I wrote for a CSE105 project last quarter:
```
    """
    Represents set of all possible transitions from one state in an NFA
    start: string representing name of start state
    arrowsList: list of all arrows, which are tuples
        of two strings (targetState, input)
    """

    def __init__(self, start, arrowsList):
        self.start = start
        self.arrowsList = arrowsList
```
